## Point transect distance sampling in inlabru
## To Do List

Need to add why we chose year 2002 to the paper

Re-do analysis in full INLA mode (not "eb")

Look up JRSS C author guidelines and some example papers for spatial applications

Explanation of the N plot, it is the posterior of the abundance, not the posterior of expected abundance
Distance Sampling people often don't think about the realisation part

Create supplmentary material for the SPDE approach

Tidy up code to match code snippets in paper and to generally be readable etc

## Thoughts on Distance Sampling Assumptions

Add to discussion something like:
It may be possible to relax the assumption of uniformity within each 
point transect.  E.g. by placing a prior on smoothness?

## To do for 1st draft ##

1.  Make figures publication ready
2.  Remove the emphasis on excursions being so great - but still keep some
stuff
3.  Add to discussion how uncertainty calculations work in DSM?
4.  Double check Buckland reference is fixed  
5.  Incorporate Rick comments

## Finn comments

1. Need to implement the better way to do posterior for N.  
2. Need to think about Covariance(exp(grf)) and whether it is worth deriving something and plotting it.  Could be a useful plot "counts this far apart are not correlated with eachother".  Talk to Finn
