## Point transect distance sampling in inlabru
## To Do List


Re-do analysis in full INLA mode (not "eb")

Try increasing montecarlo sample size for N realisation

Try looking at a few of the N pdfs to see if they are non-overlapping
and prefer certain values

Look up JRSS C author guidelines and some example papers for spatial applications

Investigate Excursions package, can it be used for this?

Explanation of the N plot, it is the posterior of the abundance, not the posterior of expected abundance
Distance Sampling people often don't think about the realisation part

Is there anything special about being a Bayesian?  Read Cornelia Bayesian DS papers


## Thoughts on Distance Sampling Assumptions

Add to discussion something like:
It may be possible to relax the assumption of uniformity within each 
point transect.  E.g. by placing a prior on smoothness?
